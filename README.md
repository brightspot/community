- Leverage REST and GraphQL APIs, including APIs for managing data (Content Management APIs) and for delivering data to the front end (Content Delivery APIs), are already built into the platform.
- Troubleshoot issues and improve performance with debugging tools that allow you to access the data directly in SQL or any database youâ€™re using, or use the interface to query data using the syntax that you would use with the DAL APIs.
