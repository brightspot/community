# Code of Conduct

At Brightspot, we believe that everyone should feel welcome and comfortable participating in public discussions. To ensure a positive and friendly environment, we have a code of conduct in place that prohibits harassment and other unprofessional behavior. 

The Contributor Covenant applies to all public forums and projects under the Brightspot organization, and we ask that you review the full text to understand the guidelines that we follow. 

Everyone should feel welcome and comfortable participating in public discussions, and we are committed to enforcing these guidelines to create a welcoming and inclusive community.

If you witness any behavior that violates this code, please report it to [devcommunity@brightspot.com](mailto:devcommunity@brightspot.com). Our team will handle all reports confidentially and take appropriate action to enforce our code of conduct.
