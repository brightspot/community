# Code of Conduct

At Brightspot, we believe that everyone should feel welcome and comfortable participating in public discussions. To ensure a positive and friendly environment, we have a code of conduct in place that prohibits harassment and other unprofessional behavior. 

The [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/) applies to all public forums and projects under the Brightspot organization, and we ask that you review the [full text](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/) to understand the guidelines that we follow. 

Everyone should feel welcome and comfortable participating in public discussions, and we are committed to [enforcing these guidelines](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/#enforcement) to create a welcoming and inclusive community.

If you witness any behavior that violates this code, please report it to [devcommunity@brightspot.com](mailto:devcommunity@brightspot.com). Our team will handle all reports confidentially and take appropriate action to enforce our code of conduct.
